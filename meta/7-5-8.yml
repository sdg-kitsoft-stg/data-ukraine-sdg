REC_USE_LIM: 1 Data have been developed since 2023. The National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission (NEURC) monitors the thermal energy market in accordance with the provisions of the Procedure for Monitoring the Thermal Energy Market, approved by the Resolution of the NEURC dated 04.10.2023 No. 1825. The said Resolution entered into force on 10.10.2023, the first period for providing information by business entities was October 2023. 2 According to monitoring data for the IV quarter of 2023, conducted in accordance with the Procedure for Monitoring the Thermal Energy Market, approved by the Resolution of the NEURC dated 04.10.2023 No. 1825 (for boiler houses of business entities in the field of heat supply that carry out activities related to the production of heat energy in a volume exceeding 20 thousand Gcal per year and/or the transportation of heat energy through main and local (distribution) heat networks in a volume exceeding 18 thousand Gcal per year and/or the supply of heat energy in a volume exceeding 18 thousand Gcal per year). 3 Data were obtained in accordance with reporting form No. 1-thermal and technical (semi-annual) "Report on the production, transportation, supply of thermal energy and use of energy resources", approved by the Resolution of the NEURC dated 03.09.2024 No. 1554, for the period from October 1, 2024 to March 31, 2025 in terms of specific fuel consumption per unit of released thermal energy from boiler house collectors (to prevent distortion of the indexer, given the lack of a unified methodology for distributing fuel consumption for released electrical and thermal energy during their combined production, indicators for combined heat and power plants, thermal power plants and cogeneration plants are not taken into account).
